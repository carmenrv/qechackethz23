    "\n",
    "This algorithm could provide an advantage in some relevant applications in the financial sector. In fact, it has been shown how to apply QAE to the problems of option pricing __[[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02666)__, risk analysis __[[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0130-6)__, __[[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07125)__, __[[5]](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/4/593)__ and also for generical tasks such as numerical integration __[[6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06987)__, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "While the estimation error bound of classical MC simulation scales as O(1/√M), where M denotes the number of (classical) samples, QAE achieves a scaling of O(1/M) for M (quantum) samples, indicating the aforementioned quadratic speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "QAE was first proposed in 2000 by Brassard and others. However, the first version of the algorithm, that is, the canonical version, requires a very high number of qubits and circuit depth, which makes it impractical in today’s NISQ devices. QAE combines Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and Grover’s Algorithm.  Later studies have focused on how to optimize the QAE algorithm. The strategy has been to remove the QPE-dependency and use only Grover iterations. It has been empirically observed that including QPE in QAE does not have any advantages, it only increases the complexity. Moreover, the removal of the QPE-dependency has resulted in reducing the resource requirements of QAE, bringing closer the possibility of practical applications of QAE in the near-term.\n",

    "3. Measuring and Post processing.\n",
